Welcome to the LPU Mess Pass Clone – the page your college app wishes it had (but you totally copied it, didn’t you? 😏).
What is this?
This is a shamelessly accurate, pixel-perfect, and slightly improved clone of the official LPU Mess Pass page. Why? Because the original was too boring, and you wanted to see if you could do it better (spoiler: you did).
